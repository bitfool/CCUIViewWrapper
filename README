The purpose for this repository is only for easy access of CCUIViewWrapper code.

It's just copy of the following thread of cocos2d forum.

CCUIViewWrapper - wrapper for manipulating UIViews using Cocos2D
http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/forum/topic/6889
//end original readme

bitfool modified this to be ARC-compliant for the Kobold2D framework for Cocos2D (iOS 4+)
which required just two changes in the CCUIViewWrapper .m file

version 1.0.1 by bitfool
